# DeepHubÂ® to InfluxDB & Grafana in Node.js

This example demonstrates how quickly you can get data from the DeepHub to a InfluxDB database via WebSocket and visualize it through a Grafana dashboard.

## Requirements

- The DeepHub is expected to be running based on [deephub-basic-setup](https://github.com/flowcate/deephub-basic-setup).
  - DeepHub: http://localhost:8081/deephub/version
  - DeepHub UI: http://localhost:8081/deephub-ui/buildinfo.json
- You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Start a system that generates location updates, e.g. one of the examples provided within this repo (parallel directory):
  -   "deephub-rest-api-basics" or
  -   "deephub-warehouse-use-case"
  

## Install Node Modules

```
npm i
```

## Running the Example

### Start your Example

This InfluxDB example requires some location updates to be processed by the DeepHub.
You can either send these location updates yourself, or you can start one of the examples mentioned in [Requirements](#requirements).

### Docker Compose

Start InfluxDB and Grafana with Docker Compose.

```
docker-compose up
```

### InfluxDB

Start publishing to InfluxDB.

```
node ./sendToInfluxDb.js
```

### Grafana

Please wait 30 seconds for Grafana to initialize the dashboard and then navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.

#### Note

If you have location updates happening in your DeepHub instance, you should already see location updates pouring in as console output for the node ./sendToInfluxDb.js process. If you don't, you may use one of the simulation examples mentioned above to generate location updates.
