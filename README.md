<h1>DeepHubÂ® usage examples</h1>

This repository contains many different code examples. They belong to different categories:
<ul>
<li>Basic code example</li>
<li>Simulation of locating systems</li>
<li>Sophisticated use-case example</li>
<li>Integration with mainstream 3rd party software</li>
</ul>

All examples within this repository can run independently of each other but may be useful together as well. The examples that simulate locating systems are e.g. very helpful when testing other examples that require live location updates but you don't actually have a locating system available or not attached to your DeepHub instance.

If you don't have your running trial instance of a DeepHub sofar, clone the <a href="https://github.com/flowcate/deephub-basic-setup">@flowcate/deephub-basic-setup repository</a> and following the instructions offered there.
