<h1>DeepHub® usage examples</h1>

The DeepHub® is a lightweight, high-performance locating-middleware, that enables a seamless indoor and outdoor tracking of objects by integrating any locating technology (UWB, BLE, RFID, 5G, etc.) of any vendor through one single modern API.

The DeepHub is the premier implementation of an omlox hub, specified in the open locating standard omlox.

This repository contains many different code examples. They belong to different categories:
<ul>
<li>Basic code example</li>
<li>Simulation of locating systems</li>
<li>Sophisticated use-case example</li>
<li>Integration with mainstream 3rd party software</li>
</ul>

All examples within this repository can run independently of each other but may be useful together as well. The examples that simulate locating systems are e.g. very helpful when testing other examples that require live location updates but you don't actually have a locating system available or not attached to your DeepHub instance.

If you don't have your own trial instance of a DeepHub sofar, clone the <a href="https://github.com/flowcate/deephub-basic-setup">@flowcate/deephub-basic-setup repository</a> and follow the instructions offered there.
